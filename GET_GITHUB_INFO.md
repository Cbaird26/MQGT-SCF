# Finding Your GitHub Repository URL

After creating the repository on GitHub, you'll see a page with setup instructions.

The repository URL will look like one of these:

HTTPS: https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/MQGT-SCF.git
SSH: git@github.com:YOUR_USERNAME/MQGT-SCF.git

To find YOUR_USERNAME:
1. Look at the URL in your browser when viewing the repository
2. Or check your GitHub profile URL
3. Or look at the "Quick setup" section on the repository page

Once you have it, I can update the remote and push!
