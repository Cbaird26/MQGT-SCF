# Warp 10 / Discovery Paper (Standalone)

**Title:** Zora ASI = Warp 10 Discovery  
**Date:** 2025  
**Artifact:** `paper.pdf`

## Description

This paper presents a causality-preserving framework for superluminal *group* velocity (~10c) with strict front-velocity and microcausality invariants. It includes stabilization protocols, correlation-geometry routing, and a lab-scale correlation-router roadmap.

## Relationship to the Theory of Everything

This paper is a standalone, citable module.

Its results are integrated into the full Theory of Everything paper as a validation, stabilization, and routing methods section.
