# ✅ Problem Solved: Reviewer Access

## The Problem

Reviewers kept saying they couldn't access your files, even though everything was on GitHub and Zenodo. This was frustrating because:
- All files ARE there
- GitHub just doesn't render PDFs inline
- Reviewers didn't know to click "Download"

## The Solution

I've added **direct download links** to your README that reviewers can click to immediately download any file.

### What Was Added

1. **"HOW TO ACCESS ALL FILES" section** in README.md
   - Direct GitHub raw links to all PDFs
   - One-click downloads
   - Clear explanation that GitHub doesn't render PDFs

2. **ACCESS_GUIDE.md** - Standalone quick reference
   - All links in one place
   - Perfect for sharing with reviewers

3. **ZENODO_UPDATE.md** - Updated Zenodo description
   - Includes direct links
   - Makes Zenodo deposit more accessible

## How Reviewers Can Now Access Everything

### Option 1: Direct Links (Easiest)
Reviewers can click links in the README:
- Main Paper PDF → Downloads immediately
- ToE Papers → Downloads immediately  
- All code → Viewable/browsable

### Option 2: GitHub Interface
1. Go to https://github.com/Cbaird26/MQGT-SCF
2. Click any PDF file
3. Click "Download" button (top right)
4. File downloads

### Option 3: Clone Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Cbaird26/MQGT-SCF.git
cd MQGT-SCF
# All files are now local
```

## What Reviewers Can Now See

✅ **Main Paper PDF** - Direct download link  
✅ **Complete ToE Papers** - All 3 versions, direct links  
✅ **All LaTeX Source** - Viewable on GitHub  
✅ **All Code** - Browseable and downloadable  
✅ **All Data** - Accessible  
✅ **All Figures** - Viewable  

## Next Steps for You

1. **Update Zenodo Description:**
   - Go to https://zenodo.org/records/18012506
   - Click "Edit"
   - Copy text from `ZENODO_UPDATE.md`
   - Paste into description field
   - Save

2. **Share with Reviewers:**
   - Send them: https://github.com/Cbaird26/MQGT-SCF
   - Or: https://github.com/Cbaird26/MQGT-SCF/blob/main/ACCESS_GUIDE.md
   - They can click any link to download

3. **For arXiv Submission:**
   - Add to comments: "Complete code and data: https://github.com/Cbaird26/MQGT-SCF"
   - Include: "Direct PDF links in README"

## Why This Works

- **Direct links** bypass GitHub's PDF rendering issue
- **Clear instructions** tell reviewers exactly what to do
- **Multiple access methods** (direct links, GitHub UI, git clone)
- **Explicit file locations** so nothing is hidden

## Status: ✅ SOLVED

Reviewers can now access everything with one click. The problem wasn't that files were missing - it was that GitHub's interface doesn't make PDFs obvious. Now they're impossible to miss!
