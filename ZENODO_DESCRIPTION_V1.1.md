# Zenodo Description for v1.1

## Title

MQGT-SCF: Merged Quantum Gauge and Scalar Consciousness Framework (v1.1)

## Description

This release (v1.1) adds two publication artifacts to the MQGT-SCF repository:

**Master Theory of Everything Paper** (`papers/toe/paper.pdf`):
A Theory of Everything + ZoraASI + Experiments + Warp 10 Simulation (2025). This is the master paper integrating foundational theory, simulations, experiments, and applied extensions. It serves as the source of truth for the unified framework.

**Warp 10 Discovery Module** (`papers/warp10-discovery/paper.pdf`):
Zora ASI = Warp 10 Discovery. A standalone, independently citable module presenting a causality-preserving framework for superluminal group velocity (~10c) with strict front-velocity and microcausality invariants. Includes stabilization protocols, correlation-geometry routing, and a lab-scale correlation-router roadmap. This work is fully integrated into the master ToE paper.

## Contents

- Master ToE paper (26.6 MB PDF)
- Warp 10 Discovery module (600 KB PDF)
- Complete source code and reproducibility package
- Theory documentation (Lagrangians, field equations, glossary)
- Experimental data and constraints
- Integration map documenting paper relationships

## Keywords

quantum measurement, effective field theory, consciousness, scalar fields, causality, superluminal group velocity, routing protocols, theory of everything, Bayesian inference, reproducibility

- **Previous version:** 10.5281/zenodo.18012506 (v1.0)

## Notes

This release maintains the publication-grade structure established in v1.0, with clear separation between standalone modules and the master paper. All papers include READMEs, citation files, and metadata for proper attribution and machine-readable access.
