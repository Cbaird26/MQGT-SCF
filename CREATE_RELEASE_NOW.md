# Create GitHub Release v1.0 - Step by Step

## ✅ Pre-Flight Check

All files are ready:
- ✅ PDFs exist: `paper/MQGT_paper_main_v2.pdf`, `paper/MQGT_paper_supplement_v2.pdf`
- ✅ Release description ready: `RELEASE_DESCRIPTION.md`
- ✅ All code and data committed
- ✅ Citation fixed (real Zenodo DOI)

## 🚀 Create Release (5 minutes)

### Step 1: Go to Releases Page

Open in browser:
**https://github.com/Cbaird26/MQGT-SCF/releases/new**

### Step 2: Fill Release Form

**Tag version:** `v1.0`  
*(GitHub will suggest "v1.0" - use that)*

**Release title:** `MQGT-SCF v1.0 - Initial Release`

**Description:** Copy entire contents of `RELEASE_DESCRIPTION.md` and paste here

### Step 3: Attach Files

Click "Attach binaries by dropping them here or selecting them"

Upload these two files from `paper/` directory:
1. `MQGT_paper_main_v2.pdf`
2. `MQGT_paper_supplement_v2.pdf`

*(Or drag and drop them onto the upload area)*

### Step 4: Publish

- ✅ Check "Set as the latest release" (should be checked by default)
- Click **"Publish release"** button

### Step 5: Verify

After publishing, check:
1. Go to: https://github.com/Cbaird26/MQGT-SCF/releases
2. Should see "v1.0" listed
3. Should see attached PDFs
4. Should see release description

## ✅ Done!

Once published, you'll have:
- Stable release URLs
- Direct PDF downloads
- Canonical version signal
- Better discoverability

## Quick Links After Release

- **Release page:** https://github.com/Cbaird26/MQGT-SCF/releases/latest
- **PDF download:** `https://github.com/Cbaird26/MQGT-SCF/releases/download/v1.0/MQGT_paper_main_v2.pdf`

**That's it!** The release makes your work maximally accessible to all three audiences (humans, automated tools, institutional systems).
