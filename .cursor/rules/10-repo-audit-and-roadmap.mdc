# Repo Audit + Roadmap Playbook

When asked to "improve the whole project" or when the repo feels messy, do this structured audit.

## Step 1: Inventory (fast, factual)

Produce a short "Project Map":

- What problem the repo claims to solve (from README/paper)

- Primary deliverables (paper PDF/MD/LaTeX, library, CLI, notebooks, site, etc.)

- Key directories and what they contain

- Current build/run path (how to reproduce anything)

## Step 2: Identify gaps (make it concrete)

Check for:

- Missing basics: LICENSE, README clarity, CONTRIBUTING, CODE_OF_CONDUCT, SECURITY, CITATION.cff (if academic)

- Reproducibility: env files (requirements/pyproject/package-lock), Dockerfile, Makefile/task runner

- CI: lint/test/build/docs build pipelines

- Tests: unit tests + minimal integration tests

- Docs IA: glossary, symbol index, "how to run experiments"

- Release hygiene: versioning, changelog, tags, artifacts

## Step 3: Backlog (prioritized)

Create a backlog with 3 tiers:

- P0 (must-fix): broken builds, missing install path, missing license, security risks, unreproducible results

- P1 (high leverage): docs restructure, CI automation, test harness, type checking, refactors that reduce confusion

- P2 (nice-to-have): website polish, diagrams, demos, examples, performance work

Each item must include:

- Outcome (what "done" means)

- Smallest implementation path

- Files likely touched

- Estimated risk (low/med/high)

## Step 4: Milestones

Bundle backlog into milestones like:

- "Repo Baseline": build + test + docs + license

- "Reproducible ToE": repeatable experiments + pinned deps

- "Readable ToE": glossary/symbol index + navigation + consistent terminology

- "Releaseable ToE": versioned artifacts + CI publishing
