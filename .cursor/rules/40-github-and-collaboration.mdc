# GitHub + Collaboration Rules

## PR/Change hygiene

- Every change should explain: motivation → approach → verification.

- Prefer conventional commit messages if the repo uses them; otherwise keep commits descriptive.

## CI expectations

- CI should run: lint, tests, basic build, and (if docs exist) docs build.

- Add caching and keep pipelines fast.

## Security hygiene

- Enable dependency scanning and secret scanning where possible.

- Never commit credentials. If found, remove and rotate (document the incident).

## Releaseability

- If the repo produces artifacts (paper PDF, docs site, packages), automate builds.

- Keep a CHANGELOG and tag versions for major milestones.
