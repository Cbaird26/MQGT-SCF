# Documentation + Paper Rules (ToE)

This repo mixes theory, notation, and implementation. Writing must reduce ambiguity.

## Clarity requirements

- Define every symbol on first use (and preferably in a central glossary/symbol index).

- Keep notation consistent across files. If notation differs, explain the mapping explicitly.

- Distinguish:

  - Definitions

  - Postulates/axioms

  - Derived results

  - Speculation / metaphors / spiritual language

- Use dimensional analysis where applicable (units sanity checks).

## Structure upgrades that are always worth it

- Add a `docs/` landing page that points to:

  - "Start here"

  - "Core definitions"

  - "Key equations"

  - "Predictions / tests"

  - "Implementation mapping"

- Maintain a glossary:

  - Term → short definition → where used → related symbols

- Maintain a symbol index:

  - Symbol → meaning → units (if any) → where defined

## Testability bias

Whenever there is a claim ("predicts", "explains", "implies"), add:

- what would count as evidence against it

- what measurement/experiment/simulation would test it

- where in code/notebooks that test lives (or should live)

## Citations

If the repo makes scientific/historical claims, cite sources or label as hypothesis.
