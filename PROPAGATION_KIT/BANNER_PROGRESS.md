## ✅ Completed (Top 8 Priority)

1. ✅ **ZoraAPI** - Created README with banner (committed)
2. ✅ **Theory-of-Everything** - Fixed LaTeX README, added banner (committed)
3. ✅ **ToE-Simulations** - Added banner to existing README (committed)
4. ✅ **ComprehensivePhysicsSolver** - Added banner to existing README (committed)

## 📋 Remaining

5. [ ] **zora-theory-of-everything** - Check if exists
6. [ ] **toe-studio** - Check if exists, add README if needed
7. [ ] **A-Theory-of-Everything** - Add banner (likely Category C - Archive)
