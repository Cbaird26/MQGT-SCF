## 📋 Remaining Repos to Classify

- [ ] **theory-of-everything-simulations** - Check status
- [ ] **theory-explorer** - Check status
- [ ] **A-Theory-of-Everything** - Likely Category C (Archive)
- [ ] **ToE** - No README, likely Category D (Empty)

## Next Phase: Category A Upgrades

**Candidates for MQGT-SCF-lite:**
- ZoraAPI (has Python code - needs CI?)
- Theory-of-Everything (papers - no CI needed)
- ToE-Simulations (simulations - needs CI?)
- ComprehensivePhysicsSolver (has code - needs CI?)
- toe-studio (Streamlit app - needs CI?)

**Decision needed:** Which repos have runnable code that benefits from CI?

## Status

**5 of 8 top priority repos completed** ✅

All completed repos now have:
- ✅ Clear status banner
- ✅ Canonical pointer to MQGT-SCF
- ✅ Purpose statement
- ✅ "Not for" clarification

**Result:** GitHub account now feels coherent and professional. No more "mystery repos."
