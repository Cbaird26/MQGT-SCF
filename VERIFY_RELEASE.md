# How to Verify Release is Live

## Quick Check

Open this URL in your browser:

👉 **https://github.com/Cbaird26/MQGT-SCF/releases**

## What You Should See (If Release is Live)

✅ **Card titled:** "MQGT-SCF v1.0 — Initial Public Release"  
✅ **Attached PDFs:** Both PDFs visible and downloadable  
✅ **Release description:** Full description shown  
✅ **Release URL:** `https://github.com/Cbaird26/MQGT-SCF/releases/tag/v1.0`

## What You'll See (If Release is NOT Live)

❌ **Message:** "There aren't any releases here"

If you see this, the release wasn't published yet. Go back to:
👉 **https://github.com/Cbaird26/MQGT-SCF/releases/new**

And make sure you click **"Publish release"** (not "Save draft").

## After Publishing

Once you see the release card, tell me:
- **"release is live"** or
- **Paste the release URL:** `https://github.com/Cbaird26/MQGT-SCF/releases/tag/v1.0`

I'll verify it immediately and confirm:
- ✅ Stable release URL
- ✅ PDFs downloadable
- ✅ Versioned citation ready
- ✅ Access problem permanently closed

---

**The release is the final infrastructure step. Once it's live, everything is complete.**
