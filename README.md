## Overview

The Merged Quantum Gauge and Scalar Consciousness Framework (MQGT-SCF) is an effective field theory extension of the Standard Model and General Relativity that incorporates scalar fields encoding consciousness-like and ethical structures. The framework is formulated operationally, with testable predictions across multiple experimental channels.

- **LaTeX source:** [papers/unified_ToE/paper.tex](papers/unified_ToE/paper.tex)

## Relationship to Prior Work

The unified ToE paper (`papers/unified_ToE/`) builds upon and integrates concepts from:

1. **Warp-5A** - Introduces the consciousness field $\Phi_c(x)$ and its quantization
2. **Warp-5B** - Develops the ethical field $E(x)$ and measurement mechanisms

The unified framework:
- Provides operational, testable constraints
- Embeds the framework in conservative EFT
- Derives falsifiable predictions across three channels
- Maintains consistency with all known physics

See `papers/unified_ToE/paper.tex` for explicit references and relationship statements.

## Novelty Claims

This work introduces:
- An operational deformation of the Born rule with ethical weighting
- Conservative EFT embedding via Higgs-portal coupling
- Multi-channel experimental constraints (QRNG, Higgs, fifth-force)
- Complete reproducibility package with cryptographic verification

The framework is conservative in that:
- All new effects decouple as couplings → 0
- Standard physics is recovered in the limit
- No violations of known symmetries (except minuscule teleological term)
- Compatible with all current experimental bounds
