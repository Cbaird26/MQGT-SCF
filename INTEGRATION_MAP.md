# Integration Map

## Source of Truth

- `papers/toe/paper.pdf` — Master Theory of Everything paper

## Standalone Modules

- `papers/warp10-discovery/paper.pdf`
  - Content: causality invariants, stabilization suite, routing shell, correlation-router laboratory roadmap
  - Status: fully integrated into ToE (methods + validation sections)

## Notes

Standalone modules remain independently citable, but conceptual authority resides in the ToE paper.
