## Relationship to MQGT-SCF

The MQGT-SCF framework (in the main repository) is an operational, testable subset of the full Theory of Everything. These papers provide:

- Complete Lagrangian formulations
- Full field equations for Φc, E, and Ψω fields
- Theoretical derivations of all diagnostic tensors
- Complete mathematical framework
- Experimental proposals and protocols

## Note on File Size

These PDFs are large (several hundred MB each) due to the comprehensive nature of the theoretical development. They are included here for completeness and full theoretical transparency.
