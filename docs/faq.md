# Frequently Asked Questions

## General

**Q: What is MQGT-SCF?**  
A: Merged Quantum Gauge and Scalar Consciousness Framework. An effective field theory extension that incorporates scalar fields encoding consciousness-like and ethical structures.

**Q: Is this peer-reviewed?**  
A: The repository is prepared for peer review. It has been archived on Zenodo (DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.18012506) and is ready for arXiv submission.

**Q: How do I cite this?**  
A: Use the Zenodo DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.18012506. See [CITATION.cff](../CITATION.cff) for machine-readable citation.

## Theory

**Q: What is the consciousness field $\Phi_c$?**  
A: A scalar field like the Higgs field, but with different dynamics. Its "consciousness" interpretation is separate from its mathematical structure.

**Q: What is the ethical field $E$?**  
A: A scalar field that encodes teleological bias. In the operational framework, it's just a scalar label that biases quantum probabilities.

**Q: How does this relate to standard quantum mechanics?**  
A: In the limit $\eta \to 0$, the standard Born rule is recovered. All effects decouple as couplings → 0.

**Q: What about the teleological term?**  
A: It's a minuscule term that breaks time-reversal symmetry. It's set so small that it doesn't conflict with observations.

## Experiments

**Q: Has this been tested?**  
A: Some constraints exist (Higgs portal, fifth-force). QRNG tests are proposed but not yet performed.

**Q: How do I reproduce the results?**  
A: Run `python reproduce_all.py`. See `code/` directory for details.

**Q: What experiments are proposed?**  
A: QRNG tests, microtubule coherence measurements, neural entanglement detection, gravitational wave echo searches. See `experiments/` directory.

## Papers

**Q: What's the difference between Warp-5A, Warp-5B, and the unified ToE?**  
A: Warp-5A introduces $\Phi_c$, Warp-5B develops $E$ and measurement mechanisms, unified ToE provides operational constraints and testable predictions.

**Q: Which paper should I read first?**  
A: Start with `papers/unified_ToE/paper.pdf` for the operational framework. Warp-5A and Warp-5B provide foundational concepts.

**Q: Where is the full 4,824-page ToE?**  
A: In `theory/ToE_papers/` directory. Key equations are extracted to `theory/` markdown files.

## Code

**Q: What programming language is used?**  
A: Python for inference and simulations. LaTeX for papers.

**Q: What are the dependencies?**  
A: See `code/requirements.txt` or `environment.yml`.

**Q: Can I contribute code?**  
A: Yes! See [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Philosophy

**Q: Is this panpsychism?**  
A: The framework is compatible with panpsychist interpretations, but the mathematics is independent of philosophical interpretation.

**Q: Does this solve the hard problem of consciousness?**  
A: No. It provides a mathematical framework. The hard problem remains philosophical.

**Q: What about free will?**  
A: The framework doesn't address free will directly. It provides a mechanism for bias in quantum outcomes.

## Future Work

**Q: What's next?**  
A: See [roadmap.md](roadmap.md) for planned work.

**Q: Can I collaborate?**  
A: Yes! See [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md) or contact the author.

**Q: Is there funding available?**  
A: This is currently independent research. Funding opportunities may arise as the work develops.
