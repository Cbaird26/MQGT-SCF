## Volume 0: Overview & Roadmap

**File:** [`MQGT_SCF_Volume_0_Overview.pdf`](MQGT_SCF_Volume_0_Overview.pdf)

This document serves as the navigational front door to the complete MQGT-SCF research collection. It provides:

- Clean title page and scope statement
- Volume map (Volumes I–III with page ranges and file sizes)
- "How to read" guidance
- Suggested reading pathways with page pointers
- Curated section marker index
- Full structural marker index (Appendix A)

**Purpose:** This overview is purely navigational—no content rewriting, no deletions, no equation modifications. It serves as the entry point for accessing the three-volume corpus.

## Three-Volume Corpus

The complete research collection is organized into three volumes:

1. **Volume I — Foundations & Core Formalism** (~2,170 pages)
2. **Volume II — Proofs, Constraints, Extensions & Computation** (~1,448 pages)
3. **Volume III — Interpretation, Applications & AI** (~1,206 pages)

**Total:** ~4,824 pages of preserved research corpus

## Accessing the Full Collection

The complete, unmodified research corpus is available through:

- **Canonical Archive (DOI):** [Zenodo Record 18050570](https://zenodo.org/records/18050570)
- **Library Mirror (Full Corpus):** [Internet Archive](https://archive.org/details/mqgt-scf-research-collection-full)

This GitHub repository links to these authoritative sources rather than mirroring large PDF files directly.

## Structured Edition

The three-volume structured edition is maintained locally in the `structural_working/` directory (outside this repository) to keep the repository lightweight. Volume 0 serves as the navigational guide to access the full collection.

## Canonical Archive

The complete, unmodified corpus is preserved in:
- **Zenodo** (canonical DOI archive with versioning)
- **Internet Archive** (public library mirror for long-term access)
- **Canonical directory** (local frozen copy for reference)
