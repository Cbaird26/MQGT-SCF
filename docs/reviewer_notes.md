# Notes for Reviewers

## What This Is

The MQGT-SCF is an **operational, testable framework** that:
- Extends quantum mechanics with an ethically-weighted Born rule
- Embeds this in a conservative effective field theory
- Derives falsifiable predictions across three independent channels
- Provides complete reproducibility

## What This Is NOT

- **Not** a complete solution to the hard problem of consciousness
- **Not** a proof that consciousness causes collapse
- **Not** a replacement for standard quantum mechanics
- **Not** a metaphysical argument without empirical content

## Key Claims (Conservative)

1. **Operational Deformation:** Quantum probabilities can be weakly biased by scalar labels
2. **EFT Embedding:** This can be embedded in a conservative EFT extension
3. **Testability:** The framework makes testable predictions
4. **Compatibility:** All effects decouple as couplings → 0

## Experimental Status

### Current Constraints
- ✅ Higgs portal: $g_\phi < 6.5 \times 10^{-3}$ (CMS data)
- ✅ Fifth-force: $\lambda < 38.6~\mu$m for $\alpha = 1$ (Lee et al. 2020)
- ⏳ QRNG: To be tested

### Proposed Tests
- QRNG experiments with ethical context
- Microtubule coherence measurements
- Neural entanglement detection
- Gravitational wave echo searches

## Theoretical Status

### Strengths
- Conservative EFT formulation
- Decoupling limit ensures compatibility
- Multi-channel constraints
- Complete reproducibility

### Limitations
- Teleological term breaks time-reversal (by design, minuscule)
- Ethical valence assignment is operational, not derived
- Full quantization of gravity + fields not yet complete
- Some parameters not yet constrained

## Common Questions

**Q: Is this just philosophy dressed as physics?**  
A: No. The framework makes testable, falsifiable predictions. The ethical weighting is operational—it's a scalar label, not a philosophical claim.

**Q: How does this relate to other interpretations?**  
A: It's compatible with many-worlds (adds bias to branch selection), decoherence (adds small correction), and objective collapse (provides mechanism).

**Q: What about the consciousness field?**  
A: $\Phi_c$ is a scalar field like any other. Its "consciousness" interpretation is separate from its mathematical structure.

**Q: Is this falsifiable?**  
A: Yes. QRNG experiments can directly test $\eta$. Higgs and fifth-force tests already constrain parameters.

**Q: Why the teleological term?**  
A: It encodes a hypothesized directionality. The term is minuscule and doesn't conflict with observations.

## Reproducibility

All results are fully reproducible:
