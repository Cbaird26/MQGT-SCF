# Theorem-Level Consistency Proofs Documentation

## Overview

Mathematical verification of internal consistency: no-signaling, stability, reduction.

## Methodology

- **No-Signaling**: Verify modified Born rule preserves causality
- **Stability**: Prove bounded energy and absence of ghosts
- **Reduction**: Prove exact recovery of GR+SM in standard limits

## Implementation

- Modules: `code/inference/theorems/no_signaling.py`, `stability.py`, `reduction.py`

## Status

Framework implemented; requires formal verification with symbolic computation.
