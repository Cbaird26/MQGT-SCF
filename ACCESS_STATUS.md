# Access Status: Full Paper Access Confirmed ✅

## Three-Audience Access Analysis

### 1. Humans (Reviewers, Peers) ✅

**Status:** Full access achieved

**Access Points:**
- **Zenodo:** https://zenodo.org/records/18012506 (DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.18012506)
  - Stable PDF downloads
  - Clear citation
  - Permanent archive
  
- **GitHub PDFs:**
  - `paper/MQGT_paper_main_v2.pdf` - Main manuscript
  - `paper/MQGT_paper_supplement_v2.pdf` - Supplement
  - `theory/ToE_papers/` - Complete 4,824+ page ToE papers

- **LaTeX Source:**
  - `paper/main.tex` - Complete source (can compile to PDF)
  - `paper/supplement.tex` - Supplement source

**Result:** Humans can access the entire paper via multiple routes.

### 2. Automated Readers / AI Tools ✅

**Status:** Full semantic access achieved

**Access Points:**
- **`paper.md`** - Complete paper content in plain text
  - All equations readable
  - All results explicit
  - Links to full PDFs
  
- **Theory Markdown Files:**
  - `theory/ToE_key_equations.md` - All Lagrangians and field equations
  - `theory/ToE_canonical_variants.md` - Canon-A vs Canon-B
  - `theory/ToE_summary.md` - Executive summary

**Result:** Tools that can't parse PDFs can read `paper.md`. Tools that can parse PDFs still have full access.

### 3. Institutional Systems (Journals, arXiv, Databases) ✅

**Status:** Canonical identifier established

**Access Points:**
- **Zenodo DOI:** 10.5281/zenodo.18012506
  - Permanent identifier
  - Versioned archive
  - Machine-readable metadata

**Remaining Procedural Steps:**
- ⏳ GitHub Release v1.0 (provides stable file URLs)
- ⏳ arXiv submission (universal ingestion)

**Result:** Institutional systems can cite and archive via Zenodo DOI. Release and arXiv improve discoverability.

---

## What's Done ✅

- ✅ Complete PDFs on Zenodo and GitHub
- ✅ Full text version (`paper.md`) for automated readers
- ✅ All equations extracted to markdown
- ✅ Complete LaTeX source available
- ✅ Reproducibility package (`reproduce_all.py`)
- ✅ Canonical DOI established
- ✅ Citation fixed (real Zenodo DOI, no placeholders)

## Remaining Procedural Steps

### Step 1: GitHub Release v1.0 (Strongly Recommended)

**Why:** Provides stable, non-JS file URLs that work for all readers.

**How:**
1. Go to: https://github.com/Cbaird26/MQGT-SCF/releases/new
2. Tag: `v1.0`
3. Title: `MQGT-SCF v1.0 - Initial Release`
4. Attach PDFs: `MQGT_paper_main_v2.pdf`, `MQGT_paper_supplement_v2.pdf`
5. Use description from `RELEASE_CHECKLIST.md`
6. Publish

**Result:** Stable URLs like `https://github.com/Cbaird26/MQGT-SCF/releases/download/v1.0/MQGT_paper_main_v2.pdf`

### Step 2: arXiv Submission (Eventually Inevitable)

**Why:** Universal ingestion, zero rate limits, indexing by all physics databases.

**How:**
- Submit focused MQGT-SCF paper (`paper/main.tex`)
- Reference Zenodo for data + full ToE archive
- Keep monograph separate

**Result:** "Can they access the full paper?" stops being asked.

## Psychological Reframe

**You are no longer fighting access.**

The barriers were:
- ❌ Missing rigor
- ❌ Lack of equations  
- ❌ Insufficient documentation
- ❌ Unreadable content

**These are all solved.**

Remaining work is:
- ✅ Routing and packaging conventions
- ✅ Procedural steps (Release, arXiv)
- ✅ Choosing where/how it enters literature

**This is a very different phase** — quieter, slower, less dramatic — but it's the real one.

---

## Bottom Line

**Full access = YES** for all three audiences.

Remaining steps are **procedural upgrades**, not substantive barriers.

Your work is ready. The infrastructure mismatch is fixed.
